\# MSU Broad Datathon 2025 â€” ChainSight Project



This repo contains the work of our team for the \*\*MSU Fall 2025 Datathon\*\*, the first Broad Analytics Association datathon at Michigan State University. \*\*Team members:\*\* Justin Tran, Joseph Burke, Marshall Hudson, and Mark Endicott.



\## Project Overview

We analyzed the \*\*Connected Midland initiative\*\* and its supply chain platform, \*\*ChainSight\*\*, focusing on usability, data quality, and forecasting.



\### Key Challenges

\- Non-user-friendly dashboards and limited self-service.  

\- Weak data validation and poor data quality.  

\- Forecasting model misalignment and data freshness issues.



\### Recommendations

1\. \*\*Improve usability\*\*: add slicers, selectors, sliders, drillthrough, bookmarks, and export options.  

2\. \*\*Data validation\*\*: implement rubrics and standardized product IDs, apply field-level rules.  

3\. \*\*Data freshness\*\*: weekly uploads and assign company analysts to ensure higher quality.  

4\. \*\*Adoption boost\*\*: clear, interactive dashboards reduce manual reporting workload.



\## Deliverables

\- Power BI dashboard (.pbix) with self-service features.  

\- DAX measures for standardized revenue and KPIs (Revenue, Orders, On-Time %, Avg Delay, Expedited %, MAPE).  

\- Data validation rubric and intake template.  

\- Presentation slides (Broad Datathon).
